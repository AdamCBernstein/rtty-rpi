Religious liberty and the family as a factory of hope: Saturday with Pope Francis

And that’s a wrap for the penultimate day of the pontiff’s US tour. Here’s the top lines:

    Pope Francis praised the “immense contribution” of women to the Catholic church in his morning mass at the Philadelphia Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul.
    Speaking to members of the Hispanic community at Liberty Hall, Francis told them “never to be ashamed” of being immigrants or of their culture. Immigrants would renew the US, he insisted.
    Francis defended religious liberty, saying it was the foundation of other liberties and the truest expression of American culture.
    The pope met and blessed disabled children.
    After another popemobile tour of the city attended by massive crowds, Pope Francis appeared at the World Meeting of Families’ festival night.
    Celebrities and singers – including Mark Wahlberg, Sister Sledge, comedian Jim Gaffigan, Andrea Bocelli and gospel legend Aretha Franklin – performed for the crowd. A lot of nuns rocked out and Wahlberg said his Catholic faith was the cause of his achievements.
    The pope once again discarded his prepared speech to preach, local pastor-style, on the family. Families’ identity cards came from God, he said. They have a “citizenship which is divine” and are the highest expression of God’s love.

Thanks for joining us again on the Guardian PopeBlog and we’ll see you again tomorrow for the final day. The centerpiece of the whole tour, a mega-mass tipped to host almost a million parishioners, will take place tomorrow. Francis will also visit a prison, and is expected to address race issues. It should be an exciting conclusion to what has been a very densely-packed tour. Until then.
